# Sports Fashion Site
Small project to get hands on experience with bootstrap. With an earthy color scheme we have created a minimalistic site that doesn't go overboard with fancy effects.\

## Run code
The site is not hosted but can be easily run on visual studio code with the Live Server extenstion. A localhost will start up and everything will be link such that the page is fully functional.

# Demo

Each page was wireframed with figma. A combo of css and bootstrap was used on a lot of the pages to make sure that everything was perfect.
